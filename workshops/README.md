Workshops
==================

The Data Library runs occasional training workshops when attendees can work along with an IPython notebook. See the San Diego Regional Data Library's [Meetup Page](http://www.meetup.com/San-Diego-Regional-Data-Library/events/192906652/) for the schedule of events. 

To participate, you should have IPython notebook running on a laptop. See the [tools setup page](https://sandiegodata.atlassian.net/wiki/display/IP/Setup+And+Learn+Your+Tools) for more details.
